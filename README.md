# Finetuning LLM Models on Custom Datasets

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of **fine-tuning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs)** on domain-specific datasets.
The primary focus is on **parameter-efficient training methods** that make it possible to adapt powerful language models for specialized tasks while reducing computational cost.

### ðŸ§© What This Project Does

* **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
  Instead of updating all model parameters during fine-tuning, LoRA injects small trainable matrices into the modelâ€™s layers. This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters, making training much faster and more memory-efficient without losing performance.

* **Quantization for Efficiency:**
  The model is quantized into **4-bit or 8-bit representations**, which reduces memory usage and accelerates inference. This enables training and deployment on **consumer-grade GPUs or CPUs**, lowering hardware requirements.

* **Domain-Specific Dataset (Medical):**
  The fine-tuning experiments are conducted on **medical text datasets**, allowing the LLM to adapt its understanding for **medical Q\&A, terminology comprehension, and clinical context recognition**.

* **Deployment on Limited Hardware:**
  The combination of LoRA + Quantization ensures that even large models can be deployed on devices with **restricted VRAM (like 8â€“12 GB GPUs)** while maintaining accuracy close to full fine-tuning.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features Explained

* **LoRA integration with Hugging Face Transformers**
  Fully compatible with Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` library, making it easy to plug into existing pipelines.

* **4-bit and 8-bit Quantization Support**
  Saves GPU memory, speeds up inference, and enables training on smaller devices.

* **Training & Inference Scripts**
  Ready-to-use Python scripts are provided to simplify both training the model and running inference.

* **Evaluation on Medical QA Tasks**
  The fine-tuned model is evaluated on domain-specific question-answering benchmarks to measure improvements in accuracy, relevance, and fluency.

âœ¨ **In summary:** This project serves as a hands-on guide to efficiently fine-tune and deploy LLMs in specialized domains, especially when working with **resource-constrained hardware**.

Do you want me to also **add usage steps (clone, install, train, inference)** directly under this explanation so itâ€™s a full README, or do you want this section kept only as a detailed description of your text?
